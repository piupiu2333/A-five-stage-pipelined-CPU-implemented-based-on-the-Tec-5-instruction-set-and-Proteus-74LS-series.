### English

This is the course project for the Computer Organization Principles course of the 17th class at Nanjing Agricultural University. It implements the functionality of an 8-bit CPU based on a pipelined structure and the TEC-5 instruction set, following the structure diagram of the MIPS pipeline. The project was mainly implemented using the hardware simulation platform PROTEUS, achieving the functionality of the TEC-5 model machine. The final system developed in this project consists of an arithmetic unit, controller, clock pulse signal generator, dual-port general-purpose register file, and instruction data memory. It can execute instructions in both manual and automatic modes. In the manual mode, instructions can be executed after manually inputting data, while in the automatic mode, the system can automatically execute seven instructions such as ADD and SUB in a pipelined manner. The project includes bypass units and control logic.
